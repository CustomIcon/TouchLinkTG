## TouchLinkTG [WIP]

Telegram: [MTCC - Bus Card](https://t.me/BusCardBot)

### Purpose
When MTCC Company took Maldivian Bus transport service and completely rewrote android/ios app it still felt weak and unuseful. Some of the missing key features was to save your own Bus card in the app to get balance, instead users have to re-enter card number each time app launches. The app provided by the original source doesnt have "Dhivehi" translation whatsoever, this telegram bot I have made defeat the mentioned problems. I have read bad reviews on the services the original source provided and as individual person I will try my best to fix everything they can not through a messaging app most Maldivians use, so users do not need to install a third party app to interact with TouchLink services.

### Important Note
I dont own MTCC or Touchlink, or the company logo. This project is done under reverse engineering MTCC API provided inside the Android App. Any user who spam request on their API endpoint using TouchLinkTG may or will be banned from using this service.
